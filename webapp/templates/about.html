    <h2>About Femicide Watch</h2>
    <p>
      Femicide Watch is a coordinated response platform that blends human-centered intake with multilingual AI triage. It was built for organizations that rely on trusted field officers to collect sensitive testimonies from survivors and witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      By pairing a curated dataset with XLM-RoBERTa, the system predicts whether a narrative describes physical, sexual, emotional, or economic violence. These insights accelerate case prioritization and reveal hotspots that demand policy attention.
